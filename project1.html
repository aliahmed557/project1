        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

            The microscopic images of the Corona virus have been colorized to facilitate viewing.
            
            The institute said on its website that the images of the emerging coronavirus are not very different from MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which appeared in 2012) or the original SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus, which appeared in 2002).
            The institute considered this not surprising, "The crowns on the surface of these viruses give the virus family its name - Corona, because it resembles the appearance of the crown."</p></center>

           <h2><u>some people asked andWorld Health Organization:-</u></h2>
         <h3>Q1:-Is it possible to wear a mask to do sports?</h3>
         <h4><big>The mask should not be worn during exercise because the mask may limit the ability to breathe comfortably</big></h4>
          <h5><big>The mask may get wet due to sweat, which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microbes</big></h5> 
           <h6><big>The mask may get wet due to sweat, which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microbes</big></h6>
           <H7><BIG>Q2:-Can the COVID-19 virus be spread by shoes?</BIG></H7>
           <p>The possibility of transmission of COVID-19 infection by shoes to individuals is very low. As a precaution, especially in homes where there are babies and young children who love or play on the floor, consider removing shoes and leaving them at the entrance to the house. This will help prevent any dirt or debris that may have stuck to the soles and shoes from being brought into the house.</p>
           <p><big>Q3:- Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the emerging coronavirus?</big></p>
          <p><big>And World Health Organization said that:-</big> </p>
         <p><big>Fact1: You can recover from illness caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19). Being infected with the new corona virus does not mean that you will be infected with the virus forever.
            Most people who get COVID-19 recover completely and get rid of the virus from their bodies. If you do get sick, be sure to treat your symptoms. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention early, but phone the health care facility first. Most patients recover with supportive care.</big></p>
         <p><big>fact2:-5G wireless networks do not spread COVID-19 infection
            Viruses cannot travel over radio waves or mobile phone networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not even have 5G networks.
            COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. The infection is transmitted to people if they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, mouth or nose</big></p>

         <p><big>fact3:-The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas where the climate is hot and humid
            From the evidence available so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. Whatever the climate, take precautions if you live in or intend to travel to an area where COVID-19 infection has been reported. Perhaps the best way to protect yourself from contracting COVID-19 is to wash your hands regularly. By doing this, you can get rid of viruses that may be stuck on your hands and thus avoid possible infection if you touch your eyes, mouth or nose.</big></p>
         <p><big>We can imagine the virus as an enemy that attacks with cell shells that cause us to encourage the existing version of the virus, the apricot, and then the infection. This vaccine has been able to obtain antibodies resulting from exposure to the virus. This high-volume scaling simulation requires high-speed computers...supercomputers.</big></p>
